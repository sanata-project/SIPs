## What is an SIP?
The Sanata Initiative Proposal (SIP) is an innovative proposal process promoted by the Sanata community. The goal of SIP is to enhance innovation capability and collaboration efficiency in open and inclusive communities. Through SIP, we hope to transform existing problems and improvement opportunities in our processes into valuable suggestions and specific action plans to better support Sanata protocol. These projects include the following three aspects:
- Development Contribution
- Community-driven public products and innovation projects.
- Innovative and high-potential research projects.

A SIP must be a clear and complete description of the initiaitive. A single initiaitive is highly recommended that contain a single key proposal or new idea. 

## Work Flow

### 1. Proposal

1. SIPs should be written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format.
2. Fork the SIP repo, and modify the [Proposal template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanata-project/SIPs/main/SIP_Proposal_Template.md) to create a proposal document. 
3. Create a Pull Request to the SIP repository, make sure the email displayed on the proposer's GitHub should be one of the authors of SIP proposal document.

### 2. Proposal Review
1. The SIP committee will review the proposal, and will vote on the proposal and it will be assigned a unique number(e.g. SIP-2) and notify the proposer.
2. The proposer change the name of PR document to the assigned name and commit.
3. The SIP committee mark the PR as a `draft` status.
4. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is assigned a unique number will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

### 3. Proposal Delivery

1.  **Delivery**
    
    If a proposal`s goal is reached, the proposers should notify the SIP committee to perform acceptance checking. They should submit a delivery document.
    Using development as an example [Delivery Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanata-project/SIPs/main/SIP_Delivery_Template.md)

2.  **Delivery Review**
    
    A carefully selected acceptance team will review and accept the proposal. Some members of the SIP committee will be assigned to review the delivery and request changes on the delivery. Their feedback needs to be resolved before a proposal is accepted.

3. **Incentive Relivery**
    
    The applicants will receive the badges representing achievement if the deliveries are accepted.
